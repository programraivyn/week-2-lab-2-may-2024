            <article><strong><em>What made me get into cooking?</em></strong>  Well, that's a great question! I'd always had the passion for cooking, especially experimentally
      since I was<br> a little girl. I'd watch Food Network faithfully, and because of our convenient set-up, I was able to practice a lot of dishes on my own while
      watching<br> many of my favorites like Emeril, Rachel Ray, Barefoot Contessa, Bobby Flay, and more! Although I honed my cooking skills from the time of adolescence,<br>
      it wasn't until COVID-19 struck that I really began exploring with culinary arts. Being restricted to the house opened me up to a world of new recipes and cooking <br>
      ideas that have stuck with me to this day. I also have more of an appreciation for homemade meals now that the majority of my food is prepared at home.<br>
      <br>
      <em>Now</em> that you've read up on my journey into the cooking world, allow me to share my <strong>Top 5 Favorite Dishes of All Time</strong>, and foods I'm interested in cooking soon!</article>
